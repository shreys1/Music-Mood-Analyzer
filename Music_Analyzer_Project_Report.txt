====================================================================
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
====================================================================

The Music Mood Analyzer is an advanced Java application that employs audio signal processing techniques, music theory principles, and AI integration to analyze music files and provide comprehensive insights about their musical characteristics. The system can determine a song's mood, key signature, chord progression, tempo (BPM), and generate appropriate descriptions for the detected musical elements.

Unlike simple audio taggers that rely on metadata, our implementation performs simulated spectral analysis, beat detection, and harmonic content assessment to deliver musically accurate results. The application integrates with Google's Gemini API for enhanced analysis capabilities and offers a modern, intuitive graphical user interface for users to interact with the analyzer.

====================================================================
2. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
====================================================================

The project is structured around the following key components:

1. Core Analysis Engine:
   - SongAnalyzer.java: Initial implementation with basic feature extraction
   - EnhancedMusicAnalyzer.java: Advanced implementation with spectral analysis and AI integration

2. Data Models:
   - SongAnalysis.java: Basic analysis result container
   - EnhancedAnalysis.java: Extended analysis with additional musical features

3. User Interface:
   - MusicMoodAnalyzer.java: Main application with Swing UI

4. External Integrations:
   - Google Gemini API for enhanced music analysis capabilities

The application follows an MVC-inspired architecture:
- Model: The analyzer classes and analysis result objects
- View: Swing UI components in MusicMoodAnalyzer
- Controller: Event handlers and analysis orchestration logic

====================================================================
3. CORE ALGORITHMS & CONCEPTS
====================================================================

The application leverages several music theory concepts and algorithms:

1. Circle of Fifths:
   Used for key detection and establishing relationships between different musical keys. The implementation traverses the circle of fifths to determine the most likely key signature based on detected harmonic content.

2. Diatonic Harmony:
   The chord family for each key follows diatonic harmony principles, where each scale degree has a corresponding chord type (major, minor, or diminished) based on the key's structure.

3. Roman Numeral Analysis:
   Chord progressions are represented using music theory's Roman numeral notation (I, IV, V, etc.) before being translated to actual chords.

4. Spectral Analysis Simulation:
   The code simulates frequency band analysis (low, mid, high) to extract harmonic content and timbral characteristics.

5. Onset Detection (Simulated):
   For BPM calculation, the application simulates the detection of note onsets and their distribution over time.

6. Machine Learning Integration:
   Through the Gemini API, the application can leverage Google's machine learning models to enhance analysis accuracy.

====================================================================
4. FEATURE DETECTION
====================================================================

a. Chord Detection
-----------------
The chord detection process involves several steps:

1. Key Determination:
   - Extract spectral features from the audio file (simulated)
   - Analyze low/mid/high frequency energy distribution
   - Compare harmonic patterns against known key signatures
   - Apply Circle of Fifths principles to determine the most likely key

2. Chord Family Generation:
   - For the detected key, generate the appropriate diatonic chord family
   - Example: For C Major, generate [C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim]

3. Chord Progression Selection:
   - Calculate harmonic complexity based on spectral features
   - Select appropriate chord progressions based on complexity, not mood
   - Apply Roman numeral analysis to map chord progressions to actual chords
   - Use a predefined mapping for all major, minor, and diminished chords to display their constituent notes

4. AI Enhancement:
   - The Google Gemini API is used to validate and enhance chord detection accuracy
   - Gemini can analyze patterns that may not be captured by the rule-based system
   - The API helps identify unique chord voicings and progressions beyond standard diatonic harmony

The chord note detection is implemented using a comprehensive database of chord structures that includes:
- Major chords (e.g., "C" maps to "C E G")
- Minor chords (e.g., "Am" maps to "A C E")
- Diminished chords (e.g., "Bdim" maps to "B D F")
- Extended handling for chord numbers (e.g., 7th chords like C7)

b. BPM Analysis
--------------
The tempo detection algorithm uses several audio features:

1. Rhythmic Density Analysis:
   - Calculate the density of note onsets in the audio
   - Higher density suggests faster tempo

2. Transient Sharpness:
   - Analyze how quickly amplitude changes occur
   - Sharper transients often indicate more defined beats

3. Energy Content Analysis:
   - Overall energy level impacts perceived tempo
   - Higher energy typically correlates with faster tempos

4. Mathematical Model:
   - Base BPM calculation: baseBPM = 90 (mid-tempo default)
   - Adjustments based on extracted features:
     * rhythmicDensity adjustment: ±60 BPM
     * transientSharpness adjustment: ±30 BPM
     * energy adjustment: ±40 BPM
   - Range clamping: 60-180 BPM
   - Rounding to nearest multiple of 4 for musical coherence

5. Gemini API Integration:
   - For challenging files, the API provides additional analysis
   - Machine learning models can detect complex rhythmic patterns

c. Mood Classification
--------------------
The mood detection system uses a sophisticated multi-feature approach:

1. Audio Feature Correlation:
   - Key signature (major keys often correlate with happy/energetic moods)
   - Tempo (faster tempos typically indicate energetic/happy moods)
   - Spectral content (brightness correlates with mood)
   - Energy levels (intensity corresponds to mood categories)

2. Rule-Based Classification:
   The system categorizes songs into mood categories based on feature combinations:
   - Happy: Major keys, higher tempos, bright spectral characteristics
   - Sad: Minor keys, slower tempos, darker timbres
   - Energetic: High energy, fast tempos, regardless of key
   - Calm: Low energy, slower tempos, smooth spectral transitions
   - Angry: Minor keys, high energy, aggressive timbral qualities
   - Romantic: Medium tempos, warm harmonic content
   - Nostalgic: Specific harmonic patterns, moderate tempos

3. AI-Enhanced Classification:
   - Google Gemini API provides advanced pattern recognition
   - Identifies complex emotional qualities beyond basic categories
   - Learns from a vast corpus of music to improve classification accuracy

====================================================================
5. INTEGRATION WITH GOOGLE GEMINI API
